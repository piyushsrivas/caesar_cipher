# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool

A simple Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the oldest and most famous encryption techniques.
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom shift value.

📌 Features:

  🔐 Encrypt any text message
  🔓 Decrypt encrypted messages
  🔁 Custom shift value
  🧠 Handles uppercase, lowercase, spaces, and special characters
  🎯 Simple and beginner-friendly Python implementation
  

What is a Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number.

Example (Shift = 3):
A → D  
B → E  
HELLO → KHOOR

🚀 How It Works?
This project uses:
ASCII values of characters,
Modular arithmetic for wrap-around (Z → A),
Separate handling for uppercase and lowercase letters.

Technologies Used:
Python 3,
ASCII character manipulation,
Basic cryptography concepts.
